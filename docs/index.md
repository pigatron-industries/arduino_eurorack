# Arduino Eurorack

Tested with the following devices, but will likely work with any 3.3v logic level device (may require changes for a 5v logic level):

- Teensy LC / 4.0 / 4.1
- Electrosmith Daisy


## Usage

Include the library with 

    include <eurorack.h>
    
Initialise the library with

    Eurorack::init();
